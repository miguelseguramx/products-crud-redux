This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# What is this? 

This is the excercise realized as result of the seccion 18 of [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-de-principiante-a-experto-creando-mas-de-10-aplicaciones/)

The code of the class is in the commit with the tag of "course-version", the rest of them are features I add to practice my knowledge in react and improve my code as well as to create a more advanced and personalized version of the project

It's app to create, read, update and delete products with redux and json-server
**The problem is the with json-server changes aren't persisted between calls**


**The goal is that at some point my project is miles away from what I do in the course and the course has only given me the essence of the project**
